## Viewing 360 Images in VR
More and more companies make use of 360 videos in their daily work. For example, construction companies can use 360 images to document their work on site, not needing as many pictures to fully show the space.

However, 360 images can be more cumbersome to view and work with according to some. needing to rotate and move the images around on a flat screen. VR could provide a highly intuitive way of viewing and collaborating using 360 images.

The images can be rendered on the inside of spheres as shown in the gif below. Thus, suddenly the 360 image becomes a physical object that can be easily interacted with and viewed, something that can't be done in real life

These spheres can be moved around, rotated and scaled with intuitive controls. Just grabbing with your hands. I imagine that in the finished application you would be able to load in a google drive or a local folder on the computer with 360 images and they will be displayed as big racks full of these spheres and can simply be grabbed.

The laser pointers on the hands are used to point out details in the images. If this application is expanded to allow for remote collaboration of multiple people, these laser pointers will help people point out things in the images more easily.

A more common, already widely used way to view 360 images in VR is by setting them as the skybox. This makes for a more immersive experience, allowing you to feel like you are standing in the spot where the picture was taken.

However, this way of viewing 360 images has some issues. Moving around or walking too much while only being able to see the 360 images will usually lead to nausea as the skybox always follows where the user moves their head, leaving them disoriented. Also, when collaborating, a person pointing at something may show differently for each person in the space and not fully line up with their version of the skybox.

The spheres solve both these problems by being actual physical objects in the 3D space. But the immersion that the skybox can provide is hard to replicate, so with the press of the trigger button, you can toggle any of the spheres as the skybox.
